# Time-Series-Analysis
This repository focuses on time series analysis and includes:

1. Reading and Plotting Time Series Data: Importing and visualizing the time series data with labels.
2. Smoothing the Series: Applying moving average smoothing with different windows.
3. Decomposing the Time Series: Separating into systematic, periodic, and random components.
4. Building Correlograms: Creating autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.
5. Transforming the Series
6. Model Selection and Forecasting: Choosing an appropriate model for forecasting using exponential smoothing (simple, double, or triple) and ARIMA methods.
7. Evaluating Residuals: Constructing correlograms of residuals and other diagnostic plots, and assessing forecast quality.
8. Model Refinement: Adjusting the model if forecasts are poor and analyzing the quality of the revised model.
