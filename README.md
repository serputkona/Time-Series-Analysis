# Time Series Analysis

This repository focuses on time series analysis and includes the following components:

## Reading and Plotting Time Series Data

- **Import and Visualization**: Reads and visualizes time series data with appropriate labels to understand trends and patterns.

## Smoothing the Series

- **Moving Average Smoothing**: Applies moving average smoothing with different window sizes to reduce noise and highlight trends.

## Decomposing the Time Series

- **Decomposition**: Separates the time series into systematic, periodic, and random components to analyze its underlying structure.

## Building Correlograms

- **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation**: Creates correlograms to analyze autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation for model selection.

## Transforming the Series

- **Transformation**: Applies necessary transformations to the series to stabilize variance or address other issues.

## Model Selection and Forecasting

- **Model Choice**: Selects appropriate models for forecasting, including exponential smoothing (simple, double, or triple) and ARIMA methods.

## Evaluating Residuals

- **Residual Analysis**: Constructs correlograms of residuals and other diagnostic plots to assess forecast quality and model performance.

## Model Refinement

- **Adjustment and Re-evaluation**: Refines the model if forecasts are unsatisfactory and re-analyzes the revised model for improved accuracy.
